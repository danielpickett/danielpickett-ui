# Design Tokens

All of the design tokens are in this package.

To get started, run

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

The yarn build task is what performs the style dictionary build steps to generate the files for each platform. Every time you change something in the style dictionary, like changing colors or adding design tokens, you will have to run this command again to generate the files.
